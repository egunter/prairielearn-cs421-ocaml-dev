Example tools and question types for CS421

# PrairieLearn Course
This repository contains example tools and question types for the PrairieLearn platform, specifically designed for the CS421 course. The tools and question types are implemented in OCaml. 

##Overview of question types
1. **Equational Re-write** question type: This question type allows students to perform equational rewrites on given expressions. It supports various mathematical operations and provides immediate feedback on the correctness of the rewrites.

2. **Proof Tree** question type: This question type enables students to construct proof trees for logical statements. It includes features for validating the structure of the proof and ensuring that each step follows logically from the previous ones.

3. **Grammer Parser** question type: This question mainly includes tools for constructing parse trees and validating the correctness.

## Installation
To use these tools and question types in your PrairieLearn course, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```git clone httlps://github.com/egunter/prairielearn-cs421-ocaml-dev.git```
