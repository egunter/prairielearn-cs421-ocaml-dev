<p>Welcome to the Regular Expression and Right Regular Grammar Tester!</p>
<p>
  The purpose of this question is to help the student master
    expressing a regular language given by an English language
    description with:
  <ul>
    <li>a regular expression</li>
    <li>a regular language</li>
  </ul>

<!-- BEGIN Question Statement -->
<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>
    Consider the set of all strings over the alphabet $\{\ a,\;
    b,\;-,\; ; \; \}$ that represent non-empty sequences of semicolon
    separated dash-surrounded non-empty strings of $a$'s and $b$'s.  A
    dash-surrounded non-empty string of $a$'s and $b$'s begins with a
    dash ($-$), followed by a non-zero length sequence of $a$'s and
    $b$'s, terminated by another dash.  Such strings are separated by
    semicolons but there is no semicolon following the last such
    string.
</p>

<p>
    For example, $-aababb-;-babaaba-;-a-$ follows the desired pattern;
    $--;-a-$ and $-aaba-;$ do not.  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In the file <tt>abdashStr_regexp</tt>, replace the placeholder text with a regular expression,
    conformant with the syntax restrictions given at the top of this question, describing the set of strings as given above.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the file <tt>abdashStr_rrg</tt>, replace the placeholder text with a (right) regular grammar describing the same set of strings.
  </li>
</ul>
