  <p>Welcome to the Lambda Calculus AlphaBeta Evaluation Tester!</p>

  <p>
    In the following, you will be given a lambda term and you will be
    asked to incrementally apply the rules of <b>alphaBeta evaluation</b>
    to full normal form (where no beta reductions are possible, even
    after using $\alpha$-equivalence).
  </p>
  <p>
    The lambda ($\lambda$) in lambda terms is represented using the
    percent symbol (%). Variables must begin with an alphabetic
    character (upper or lower case), but then may additionally be
    followed by other alphabetics, numerics (0-9) and prime (').  Any
    term or subterm may be wrapped in parentheses.  Application binds
    more tightly than abstraction and associates to the left.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a worked example showing the syntax you should use to
    enter your work.  The starting lambda term is is:</p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace;">
    (% x. x (% y. x y))((% u. u)(% w. y w))<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    The steps of one way of working the problem are:
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace;">
    (% x. x (% y. x y))((% u. u)(% w. y w))<br/>
    -B-> (% x. x (% y. x y)) (% w. y w)<br/>
    =a= (% x. x (% z. x z)) (% w. y w)<br/>
    -B-> (% w. y w) (% z. (% w. y w) z)<br/>
    -B-> y (% z. (% w. y w) z)<br/>
    -B-> y (% z. y z)<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      In doing the problem below, every step must be entered separately, pushing the
      Check button after each individual step.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each line you enter is of one of two forms:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;"> =a= </span>
        <it>term</it>$\quad$ if the given step is an $\alpha$-equivalence.
        You may apply $\alpha$-equivalence as any step.  There may be
        instances in which it is necessary.  Using
        $\alpha$-equivalence will not directly gain you points,
        although doing it incorrectly will count as an error.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;"> -B-> </span>
        <it>term</it>$\quad$
        if the given step is a $\beta$-reduction compatible with the
        definition of <b>$\alpha\beta$-evaluation</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your final term should be one that can not be reduced by
        $\beta$-reduction any further, even after swapping the term for
        one that is $\alpha$-equivalent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>You must enter one step at a time and you need to click Check
    after each step you enter.</b>
